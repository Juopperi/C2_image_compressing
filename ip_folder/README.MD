This is a repository for a custom IP core. When synthesizing and implementing our design in Vivado, we need to package our modules as IPs and integrate them within a Block Diagram. To streamline this process, we used Vivado to package and export our IP into a standalone folder. This allows others to directly reuse the IP in their own development, and to modify, debug, or improve it as needed during further iterations.
